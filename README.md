## GloboStop (FlatPlay)
This is a research project that aims to answer some simple questions.
- Why does my old grandmother's phone suck so much to stream globoplay's content?
- How does Globo do it? How is it different from Disney?

Also, I wanted to play a little bit with the media framework on android, it's been a while since i don't do anything meaningful with it.
That's actually the main reason this project exists.

I'll try to document some interesting things I find while reverse engineering Globoplay's application.
