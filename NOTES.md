## Notes
- It uses GraphQL for the API communication
  - Yep, Apollo. Meta memes!
  - Initially boring to find the points of interest.
- The base url is: https://cloud-jarvis.globo.com/graphql/
  - It's not 100% clear how this is configured for the first time. Maybe I missed something.
  - Is globo trying to meme Marvel? Would I find that they call some services are called "Thanos"?
- When globoplay's app is starting (on it's splash screen) it tries to update all of the remote configs, including the base url for the apollo client.
- The app has a list of hardcoded strings called "scopes". It fetches the remote configs for each scope.
- It also does some strange memes with the locale for some reason. It just returns a tenant `globo-play` and locale `BR`
- Although it asks for the location permission, the IP address overrides it. (It's a streaming app, so this is probably fine)
